        A Liturgy for Embracing Both Joy and Sorrow
        </title>

         <p>
             For joy that denies sorrow is neither hard-won, nor true, nor eternal. <br> <b>It is not real joy at all. </b> <br>
         </p>
        <hr/>
         <p>
         And sorrow that refuses to make space for the return of joy and hope, in the end becomes nothing more than a temple for the worship of my own woundedness.
         </p>
         <hr/>
         <p>
             Amidst the pain that lades these days, give me courage, O Lord. <br> <b> Courage to live them fully, to love and to allow myself to be loved, to remember, grieve, and honor what was, to live with thanksgiving in what is, and to invest in the hope of what will be. <br/> </b>
